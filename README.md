# Wes Bos - ES6 for Everyone (Personal Repo)

This is my personal repo for Wes Bos' course ES6 for Everyone. This repo is intended to house all experiments, projects and tests I'll be doing regarding this course. 

## Overview

I'll be dividing my practice files into different folders depending on the lesson requirements. Whatever files I'll be hosting isn't meant to be the best, the proper or the only impelementation for each topic. It is more of a collation of my attempts at tackling said exercises.
